<h1>The Best Movies According to Kris</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>What a movie! This is one of the best movies on Netflix. I was not expecting so many twists and turns, totally unpredictable. It deserves more recognization.</p>
<h3>Spider-Man: Far From Home</h3>
<p>Spider-Man: Far from Home is an incredible sequel, dealing with the aftermath of Avengers: Endgame whilst still being it's own film. A fun, unpredictable and refreshingly meta MCU film that's better than its predecessor.</p>
<h3>Teen Wolf: The Movie</h3>
<p>Excellent! I watched this from season 1 when it was first released. It's also fantastic to see them grown up but their personalities haven't changed. Great film and kept faithful to the Teen Wolf TV series franchise and the general wolf genre. </p>
